# API Curious

##Project Description

This is my first official project at Turing consuming APIs. I created a
dashboard related to political information and activity based on a user's
zip code.

I used Twitter OmniAuth to log users in, and the Sunlight Foundation API to
populate the information on a user's profile.

##Project Focus

The main focus of this project was to learn how to consume APIs. It was also
my first individual project using Rails, so a secondary focus was to practice
and cement skills in various web development areas including app design,
git workflow, workflow management tools, dev ops, and TDD.
